# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis Python
I utilized **Python** (**Jupyter notebooks** and the **Anaconda Libraries Manager**) to perform Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Consistency Checks and Data Wrangling for datasets pertinent to Instacart. Subsequently, I compiled a comprehensive report in Excel outlining the methodology of my analysis, along with the findings and recommendations addressing key business inquiries for Instacart.

# Objective
As an analyst for Instacart, I'm tasked with delving into customer data to uncover distinct purchasing behaviors and preferences. Instacart aims to refine its marketing strategy by segmenting customers effectively. Through exploratory analysis, I'll identify key customer segments and their purchasing patterns. This insight will enable Instacart to tailor marketing campaigns, ensuring they resonate with specific customer profiles. Ultimately, the goal is to optimize sales by offering the right products to the right customers, enhancing overall user experience and profitability.

# Key Questions
1. The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
2. They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when peoplespend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
3. Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
4. Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.
5. The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ.
   - What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?
   - Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
   - Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
   - Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
   - What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
   - What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.
